# Basics

Work with 1 `Maybe`

@docs isJust, isNothing, join, filter


# Get a value out of a `Maybe`

@docs unwrap, unpack


# Or

Take the first value that's present

@docs or, orElse, orList, orLazy, orElseLazy, orListLazy, oneOf


# Lists of `Maybe`s

@docs values
@docs combine, traverse, combineArray, traverseArray


# toList

@docs toList, toArray
@docs cons


# andThenN

These functions are just like [`andThen`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Maybe#andThen), except they take multiple arguments.

All arguments must be `Just` and the function must return a `Just` for the result to be `Just`.

If you need a version of `andThenN` that takes more than 4 arguments, you can chain together [`andMap`](#andMap) calls in a pipeline.

    isJust (Just [])

isJust : Maybe a -> Bool
isJust m =

isNothing : Maybe a -> Bool
isNothing m =
    case m of
        Nothing ->
            True

        Just _ ->
            False


{-| Flattens nested `Maybe`s

    join (Just (Just 1))
    --> Just 1

    join (Just Nothing)
    --> Nothing

    join Nothing
    --> Nothing

-}

join mx =
    case mx of
        Just x ->
            x

        Nothing ->
            Nothing


{-| Keep the `Maybe` only if the predicate function passes

    filter (\v -> v == 1) (Just 1)
    --> Just 1

    filter (\v -> v == 2) (Just 1)
    --> Nothing

    filter (\v -> v == 1) Nothing
    --> Nothing

-}
filter : (a -> Bool) -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
filter f m =
    case m of
        Just a ->
            if f a then
                m

            else
                Nothing

        Nothing ->
            Nothing



-- Get a value out of a `Maybe`


{-| Like using a `case`.
Give a function that says what to do if the input is `Just`,
and a value to use if the input is `Nothing`.

These are all equivalent:

    unwrap default f maybeX

    maybeX
        |> Maybe.map f
        |> Maybe.withDefault default

    case maybeX of
        Just x ->
            f x

        Nothing ->
            default

Except that unlike a `case`, the default value for `unwrap` is always computed.
If your default value is expensive to compute, use the lazy [`unpack`](#unpack) instead.

Examples:

    unwrap 0 String.length Nothing
    --> 0

    unwrap 0 String.length (Just "abc")
    --> 3

-}
unwrap : b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
unwrap default f m =
    case m of
        Nothing ->
            default

        Just a ->
            f a


{-| Like [`unwrap`](#unwrap), but the default value is lazy,
and will only be computed if the `Maybe` is `Nothing`.

    unpack (\() -> 0) String.length Nothing
    --> 0

    unpack (\() -> 0) String.length (Just "abc")
    --> 3

`unpack (\() -> default) f maybeX` is equivalent to

    case maybeX of
        Just x ->
            f x

        Nothing ->
            default

-}
unpack : (() -> b) -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
unpack default f m =
    case m of
        Nothing ->
            default ()

        Just a ->
            f a



-- Or: Combine 2 `Maybe`s


{-| Returns the first value that is present, like the boolean `||`.

Both values will be computed. There is no short-circuiting.
If your second argument is expensive to calculate and you need short circuiting, use [`orLazy`](#orLazy) instead.

    or (Just 4) (Just 5)
    --> Just 4

    or (Just 4) Nothing
    --> Just 4

    or Nothing (Just 5)
    --> Just 5

    or Nothing Nothing
    --> Nothing

Advanced functional programmers will recognize this as the
implementation of `mplus` for `Maybe`s from the `MonadPlus` type
class.

-}
or : Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
or ma mb =
    case ma of
        Nothing ->
            mb

        Just _ ->
            ma


{-| Piping-friendly version of [`or`](#or).

    Just 5
        |> orElse (Just 4)
    --> Just 5

    orElse (Just 4) (Just 5)
    --> Just 5

    List.head []
        |> orElse (List.head [ 4 ])
    --> Just 4

-}
orElse : Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
orElse ma mb =
    case mb of
        Nothing ->
            ma

        Just _ ->
            mb


{-| Returns the first value that is present.

All values will be computed.
If your arguments are expensive to calculate, use [`orListLazy`](#orListLazy) instead.

    orList
        [ Nothing
        , Just 1
        , Just 2
        ]
    --> Just 1

    orList
        [ List.head []
        , String.toInt ""
        ]

    orList []
    --> Nothing

-}
orList : List (Maybe a) -> Maybe a
orList maybes =
    case maybes of
        [] ->
            Nothing

        Nothing :: rest ->
            orList rest

        (Just answer) :: _ ->
            Just answer


{-| Lazy version of [`or`](#or).

The second argument will only be evaluated if the first argument is `Nothing`.

    orLazy (Just 4) (\() -> Debug.todo "Expensive calculation")
    --> Just 4

-}
orLazy : Maybe a -> (() -> Maybe a) -> Maybe a
orLazy ma fmb =
    case ma of
        Nothing ->
            fmb ()

        Just _ ->
            ma


{-| Lazy version of [`orElse`](#orElse).
Piping-friendly version of [`orLazy`](#orLazy).

The first argument will only be evaluated if the second argument is `Nothing`.

    Just 4
        |> orElseLazy (\() -> Debug.todo "Expensive calculation")
    --> Just 4

-}
orElseLazy : (() -> Maybe a) -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
orElseLazy fma mb =
    case mb of
        Nothing ->
            fma ()

        Just _ ->
            mb


{-| Lazy version of [`orList`](#orList)

Stops calculating new values after the first match

    orListLazy
        [ \() -> Nothing
        , \() -> Just 1
        , \() -> Debug.todo "Expensive calculation"
        ]
    --> Just 1

-}
orListLazy : List (() -> Maybe a) -> Maybe a
orListLazy maybes =
    oneOf maybes ()


{-| Try a list of functions against a value. Return the value of the first call that succeeds (returns `Just`).

        |> Maybe.withDefault UnknownInput
    --> FloatInput 5.6

-}
oneOf : List (a -> Maybe b) -> a -> Maybe b
oneOf fmbs a =
    case fmbs of
        [] ->
            Nothing

        fmb :: rest ->

                Nothing ->
                    oneOf rest a



-- Lists of `Maybe`s


{-| Take all the values that are present, throwing away any `Nothing`s.

Equivalent to [`List.filterMap identity`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/List#filterMap).

    values [ Just 1, Nothing, Just 2 ]
    --> [ 1, 2 ]

-}
values : List (Maybe a) -> List a
values =
    List.foldr cons []


{-| If every `Maybe` in the list is present, return all of the values unwrapped.
If there are any `Nothing`s, the whole function fails and returns `Nothing`.

    combine []
    --> Just []

    combine [ Just 1, Just 2, Just 3 ]
    --> Just [ 1, 2, 3 ]

    combine [ Just 1, Nothing, Just 3 ]
    --> Nothing

-}
combine : List (Maybe a) -> Maybe (List a)
combine =
    List.foldr (map2 (::)) (Just [])


{-| Like [`combine`](#combine), but map a function over each element of the list first.

If every function call succeeds (returns `Just`), `traverse` will return a list.
If any function call fails (returns `Nothing`), `traverse` will return `Nothing`.

`combine` is equivalent to `traverse identity`.

    traverse (\x -> Just (x * 10)) [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
    --> Just [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ]

    traverse List.head [ [1], [2, 3], [] ]
    --> Nothing

-}
traverse : (a -> Maybe b) -> List a -> Maybe (List b)
traverse f =
    List.foldr (\x -> map2 (::) (f x)) (Just [])


{-| Like [`combine`](#combine),
but works on [`Array`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Array) instead of `List`.
-}
combineArray : Array.Array (Maybe a) -> Maybe (Array.Array a)
combineArray =
    Array.foldl (map2 Array.push) (Just Array.empty)


{-| Like [`traverse`](#traverse),
but works on [`Array`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Array) instead of `List`.
-}
traverseArray : (a -> Maybe b) -> Array.Array a -> Maybe (Array.Array b)
traverseArray f =
    Array.foldl (\x -> map2 Array.push (f x)) (Just Array.empty)



-- toList


{-| A `Maybe` is a lot like a list that can only be length 0 or 1.

Returns a singleton list if the value is present, and an empty list it's missing.

    toList Nothing
    --> []

    toList (Just 1)
    --> [ 1 ]

-}
toList : Maybe a -> List a
toList m =
    case m of
        Nothing ->
            []

        Just x ->
            [ x ]


{-| Like `toList`, but returns a singleton or empty [`Array`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Array).

    import Array

    toArray Nothing
    --> Array.fromList []

    toArray (Just 1)
    --> Array.fromList [ 1 ]

-}
toArray : Maybe a -> Array.Array a
toArray m =
    case m of
        Nothing ->
            Array.empty

        Just x ->
            Array.repeat 1 x


{-| Add an item to a list only if it's a `Just`.

    cons (Just 1) [ 2, 3 ]
    --> [ 1, 2, 3 ]

    cons Nothing [2, 3 ]
    --> [ 2, 3 ]

-}
cons : Maybe a -> List a -> List a
cons item list =
